## Advice from Bianca Kramer & Jeroen Bosman (101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication, Librarians Utrecht University)

Make survey in different languages
 - Think about translation equivalents
 - Cultural differences in responses
 
Ethical approvals
  - If ethically approved then later easier to find collaborating institutions or groups who are able to pass it to their members
  
 Communications
  - Be visual!
  - Tweet!
  - Mobile-friendly
  - Talk about it/look for conferences, mailing lists, universities, societies
  - Be as easy as possible
  - Honest about how long it takes, what it is for, and what will happen with the data
  - Progress bar!
  
 Use dropdown/pre-set options as much as possible
 
 Add a 'no answer' or 'does not apply to me' button to almost all questions
 
 Give feedback to people
 
 Qualitiative scoring
 
 Multiple test versions -> create toy version, put into the world, find out what to keep and what to change and repeat

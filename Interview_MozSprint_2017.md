## Why Not Open Science? | #mozsprint June 1-2, 2017

Daniela (@Neurosarda) and Amie (@amiefairs) are PhD students and open science advocates. 
They met at OpenCon 2016 and bonded over their shared interest in helping researchers transition to open science. 
This inspired their project, Why Not Open Science?, which they brought to our recent Mozilla Open Leaders cohort.

I (Abigail Cabunoc Mayes) interviewed Daniela and Amie to learn more about “Why Not Open Science?” and how you can help 
June 1-2 at #mozsprint.

#### What is “Why Not Open Science?”?
Why Not Open Science? is a project where we want to find out why researchers are not practising open science, and how we can help 
them do more open science. At the moment, we are developing a survey that we will send out to researchers all around the world. 
It asks them what they know about open science, what they think is good about it, what they think is bad about it, and what could be 
done to help them practice open science more in their everyday work. We hope this information will help us and other people develop 
educational materials and inform open science institutional policy.

#### Why did you start “Why Not Open Science?”? 
We (Daniela and Amie) met at OpenCon 2016 in Washington DC. Daniela asked a question about 
the existence of a tool, checklist, or some kind of practical guideline that would help researchers learn about and transition to open 
science practices. The answer was...not really! Amie felt the same, so we connected and started brainstorming ideas on how we could go 
after the problem that, despite the increasing evidence that shows the advantages of opening up scientific outputs, most academics have 
not yet embraced open science. Based on our experience, the problem has more to do with the lack of peer pressure, time, and knowledge 
about open science tools than the fear of having research ideas “stolen”. But we might be wrong and, since we are both scientists that 
prefer facts over anecdotes, we thought that the best way to start is learn about the problem; hence, the survey.

#### What do you plan on doing with the survey results?
We plan to use the results of the survey in multiple ways. First, we will share the survey questions, the anonymized data, and the 
results with the public hoping that it will be useful to other open science advocates out there. Second, we are hoping the results will 
help us develop or adapt existing educational material (such as practical guidelines, workshops, etc) to help researchers learn how and 
what they can do to make their work open at all stages of the research process. Additionally, the results could be used by institutions 
to help inform their open science policy. We would love to see open science taught in colleges and graduate programs – especially at the 
beginning of degree programs. The transition to open science is happening. It’s just a matter of making this transition happen efficiently 
and rapidly.

#### What problems have you run into while working on this project?
Loads of them! The main problem for both of us right now is time, as we are both trying to finish our PhDs and we live in different time 
zones (9 hours apart), so it’s been a bit of a challenge to coordinate Skype calls. Luckily, we live in an era with tons of awesome 
collaborative tools such as GitHub and Google docs.  Aside from that, we are finding it particularly challenging to develop an unbiased 
survey. We both love open science, so it’s hard not to have our opinion “bleed through” into what we are asking and how we are asking it. 
Just designing the questions to get the right information out can be tricky. Despite these problems, we really enjoy working together on 
issues that we are both so passionate about, and we hope to bring more people in to help us making open the standard in the world of 
academia.

#### What kind of skills do I need to help you?
Passion and open-mindedness are the only prerequisites! We would like to see our project reach further than just our own institutions, 
so having people that can help us see the problem from different perspectives, cultural and scientific, would be extremely valuable. We 
could immediately use help getting contributors to take our pilot survey and provide feedback on the survey itself, especially in helping 
us make an unbiased survey. Furthermore, we need help making a website for the project that can host information about it and the final 
survey itself. We would love to have a logo for the project, so if you are a designer by profession or even at heart, please come join 
us! In the long term, we would love to get help building a continuously up-to-date website or platform where researchers can find all the 
resources they need to facilitate the transition to open science.

#### How can others join your project at #mozsprint 2017?
We will be in person in Tilburg, the Netherlands (Amie) and in Portland, Oregon (Daniela), so if you are around you can come work in 
person with us! Check out our repo for more info about the project. We will be updating it throughout the Sprint, particularly adding 
more issues that specify the projects you can help us with at the Global Sprint. We will have an etherpad and a gitter chat going where 
you can join the discussion from wherever in the globe you are - all the information will be in the readme in the repo. If you have 
questions from now to the Sprint, you can contact us at whynotopenscience@gmail.com.

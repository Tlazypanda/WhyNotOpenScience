## Project: Why Not Open Science?
(This document is updated regularly so check back!)

We are scientists who want to see open science practices incorporated in every researcher's lab workflow.
Open science roughly means that the entire scientific process, from idea generation to the finished project, should be open and accessible to everyone. Although being open has many advantages for the research and for the researchers â€“ it increases reproducibility, accelerates progress, fosters collaboration, and broadens the impact, academics have yet to fully embrace such practices. 

Our project will develop around three stages:
1) *Listen*
2) *Develop*
3) *Educate & advocate*

The first three months are dedicated to Stage 1) *Listen*. 

## Timeline

### April-May 2017
[ ] Decide on the scope of the project. 

* What do we want the survey's results to tell us that we don't alrady know?
* Towards who will we tailor the survey? 
* What do we need to focus in order to design a survey that gets the right answers?
  Thank to the suggestion of Abdoul from the awesome Mozilla community we now know that we want to:
 
 * __Be neutral__ in the language and throughout the survey. A general good rule of thumb is that nothing should suggest that we prefer one type of answer rather than other. Doing so will lead the respondent toward answering in the direction he/she considers is good for us. This is a tough one for us as we are obviously biased as open science advocates.

 * __Code questions as much as possible__. This means that when we can we should try to present option answers for each question to ease the data analysis. However, some of the questions should be open, particularly the questions where we are trying to get an opinion. For these questions we may influence answer by providing a list of answers.

 * __Keep the survey short and easy__. People are very busy and we need to think about the trade-off between "nice to know" *versus* "must know" based on what we want to obtain from the survey.

[x] Research previous surveys 
 - [Wellcome Trust](https://figshare.com/articles/Survey_of_Wellcome_researchers_and_their_attitudes_to_open_research/4055448)
 - [Innovations in Scholarly Communication](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/)
 
[ ] Make a short report of what's arleady known.

[x] Create a pilot survey
 - Decide on the software. Google docs will be a good start, but it does not have a lot of cool features. LimeSurvey? SurveMonkey?
 - [Pilot survey]()

### June 1,2, 2017
[ ] Launch the project at the [Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/)!!! Get collaborators and people who are willing to test our pilot survey and give us feedback.

### June-July
[ ] Get ethical approval from institutions to survey researchers (ask Robin!)
[ ] Get the survey ready to be distributed to researchers. 
[ ] Launch! Communication at full power to disseminate the survey through our network.


### July-October 2017
Data collection

### November-December
Data analysis

### January 2018 onwards
Begin with part 2) *Develop!*

## Project: Why Not Open Science?
We are scientists who want to see open science practices incorporated in every researcher's lab workflow.
Open is the way science should be! Open science roughly means that the entire scientific process, from idea generation to the finished project, should be open. It promotes reproducibility, accelerates progress, and communicates scientific knowledge in a complete and transparent way. These aspects of openness are necessary for scientific advancement, yet to some extent have been hindered by the culture within research, and there aren't so many scientists who are practising open.
Why not? This is what we aim to answer, with this survey. We will ask scientists why they do and do not practice open science, and what kinds of obstacles are holding them back.

Our overall project has three main aims:
1) Listen
2) Develop
3) Educate & advocate

The first three months are dedicated to 1) Listen, with tentative planning for later months. This will be updated regularly so check back!

## Timeline and goals
### Early April 2017
Decide on the scope of the project
 - Who will we tailor the survey towards? Potentially, we will make it relevant to a research field, rather than all researchers as a start point. Why? Because we need to ask the right questions, and by initially restricting questions to a research field we can design a comprehensive and well-structured survey.

Research previous surveys and make a short report.
 - Wellcome Trust
 - Innovations in Scholarly Communication

What questions should the survey answer?
 - see GOALS

### Late April
Refine the topics the survey should cover.

Discuss the structure and design of the survey with experienced psychologists/survey implementers.

## Project: Why Not Open Science?
We are scientists who want to see open science practices incorporated in every researcher's lab workflow.
Open is the way science should be! Open science roughly means that the entire scientific process, from idea generation to the finished project, should be open and accessible to everyone. Although being open has many advantages for the research and for the researchers -- it increases reproducibility, accelerates progress, fosters collaboration, and broadens the impact, academics have yet to fully embrace such practices. 
We want to learn about reschears' current level of engagement with open science practices and learn about the main obstacles that are preventing researchers from fully embracing open.

Our project will develop around three phases:
1) Listen
2) Develop
3) Educate & advocate

The first three months are dedicated to 1) Listen, with tentative planning for later months. This will be updated regularly so check back!

## Timeline
### Early April 2017
Decide on the scope of the project
 - Who will we tailor the survey towards? Potentially, we will make it relevant to a research field, rather than all researchers as a start point. Why? Because we need to ask the right questions, and by initially restricting questions to a research field we can design a comprehensive and well-structured survey.

Research previous surveys and make a short report.
 - Wellcome Trust
 - Innovations in Scholarly Communication

What questions should the survey answer?
 - see GOALS

### Late April
Refine the topics the survey should cover.

Discuss the structure and design of the survey with experienced psychologists/survey implementers.

### Code of Conduct 

We are following the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines, which you can find here:
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/

A summary of these guidelines as applied to our project is:

**Diversity and Inclusion**

We welcome and encourage participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.


**Interaction Style**

This is a more general section about how we treat each other. Each aspect is an important part of the community we’re building.

 * __Be respectful.__ We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We will all experience some frustration now and then, but we don’t allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
 * __Try to understand different perspectives.__ Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
 * __Do not threaten violence.__
 * __Empower others to speak.__
 * __Strive for excellence.__ For our products to be great our communities must be healthy and vigorous. Being respectful does not mean papering over disagreements or accepting less than we can do.
 - Don’t expect to agree with every decision.

If you feel there are problems with contributors being included, whether it is yourself or others, or if there are any problems with interaction between contributors, please contact the Project Leads Amie Fairs or Daniela Saderi at whynotopenscience@gmail.com. We strive to create a fully inclusive atmosphere for our contributors, and if something is not going well then we want to know about it. Thank you for your collaboration!

## Welcome to *Why Not Open Science?*

Here is our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/WhyNotOpenScience/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) chat room and our [etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/whynotopenscience)! 

The *Why Not Open Science?* project aims to develop a survey to help us find out about researchers' attitudes towards open science and learn about the barriers preventing them from carrying it out. Our goal is to distribute the survey to researchers all around the globe and then use the results to inform current open science training materials and institutional policies.

### What is Open Science? 
Open is the way science should be! Just think about it: If you are a scientist you should care about generating knowledge that can contribute to the common goal of advancing our understanding of the world. Being open and transparent about your experimental methods, your data, and your results makes your work more likely to be shared, useful, and, most importantly, reproducible!

If you are not a scientist you should know that most research is funded through tax payer money and private donations. Anyone, including you, should be able to read about the most recent scientific discoveries and benefit from it without paying impossible fees or having to spend hours trying to dig out of the web some shared piece of data that might not even exist.

### So, what's the problem?

Despite the growing evidence that open science practices benefit discovery and individual careers [(McKiernan *et al.*, 2016)](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800), many academics hesitate to incorporate open science in their research routines. Why? Is it the fear of being “scooped”? Is it the lack of peer pressure and institutional rewards? Or, is it a lack of time and knowledge about open science practices? 

Survey data collected between 2015-2016 as part of the Innovation in Scholarly Communication project (https://101innovations.wordpress.com/) revealed that 80.9% of the surveyed researchers support the goals of open science, and 85.9% support the goals of open access movements. Given these results and based on our experience as researchers and open science advocates, we believe that barriers are mostly cultural (lack of peer-pressure) as well as technical (lack of time and knowledge about open science tools).

### Got it! What can we do about it?

* *Listen*: We believe that scientific inquiry should avoid erroneous preconceptions or assumptions about a problem. Therefore our first step will be to develop a survey to explore in depth the underlying reasons for failure to adopt open science practices in academia. Initially we will test the survey in our home institutions, but our goal is to distribute the survey to other academic institutions across the globe.

     The survey will seek to:
     * Understand researchers’ knowledge of and engagement with open science practices; 
     * Learn about obstacles that prevent them from engaging in open science practices; 
     * Ask what would incentivize them to adopt open science practices.

* *Develop*: Based on the results of the survey, and existing educational materials, we seek to develop comprehensive workshops to educate academics on the benefits of engaging with open science practices and to overcome obstacles they face.

* *Educate and advocate*: With the development of the materials, we will run workshops on engagement with open science practices and make the workshop materials publicly available, so they can be used by anyone with an interest in open science.

### #MozSprint 2017

During the Sprint we will be around in two different locations - Tilburg, Netherlands and Portland, Oregon. If you are around, come drop by! If you are working globally, then we'll have a gitter chat going, an etherpad for chatting and notes, and we'll be available through skype. Check back for more info and the links!

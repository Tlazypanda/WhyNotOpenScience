### Contributing to Why Not Open Science?

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! We are really excited to welcome contributors to this project. We really value the time you take to work on the project.

What is this project? We want to know why, despite researchers knowing that practising open science has positive benefits for themselves, research, and society as a whole, the uptake of encorporating open science practices into daily work has been slow. To find out, we are designing a survey to ask researchers: what do you do to make your work more open? Why do you do it? What don't you do? And why don't you do it?

#### Contributing guidelines

#### What are we working on?

The overall project is to work on designing, creating, and carrying out a survey.
[Here](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) is our general project roadmap, and you can find issues under the issues tab at the top, or [here](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/issues). Our milestones and aims are listed as issues so you can read through them or search the labels. If you are new to contributing, we have some [good first bugs](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/labels/good%20first%20bugs).

#### How to contribute?

Once you have an issue you want to contribute to, then please:

1. **Fork the repository**. Create your own version of the repository.
2. **Make your changes**. Change the project and work on your issue.
3. **Commit changes**. Commit your changes.
4. **Create a pull request**. Submit a pull request so the leads see that there are changes, and so that there can be a discussion around your changes.

#### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, any issues with design, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster.

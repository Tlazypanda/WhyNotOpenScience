## Contributing to *Why Not Open Science?*

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! We are excited to welcome contributors and we really value the time you take to work with us on this project.

### What are we working on right now?

We are at Stage 1 of your mission, *Listen*. We want to assess researchers' attitudes towards open science and learn about the main barriers to fully adopt open science practices in their daily routines. To do that we are designing a survey that we are hoping to distribute to scholars around the globe. 

[This](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) is our project roadmap, and you can find issues under the issues tab at the top, or [here](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/issues). Our milestones and aims are listed as issues so you can read through them or search for the labels. If you are new to contributing, we have some [good first bugs](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience/labels/good%20first%20bugs) you can check out.

### The survey

We (Amie and Daniela) are not survey experts so we turned to our network (shout out for awesome Mozilla!) and we got in contact with Abdoul and Paul who helped us figure out some important points to consider when designing a survey. 

* __Be neutral__ in the language and throughout the survey. A general good rule of thumb is that nothing should suggest that we prefer one type of answer rather than other. Doing so will lead the respondent toward answering in the direction he/she considers is good for us. This is a tough one for us as we are obviously biased as open science advocates.

* __Code questions as much as possible__. This means that when we can we should try to present option answers for each question to ease the data analysis. However, some of the questions should be open, particularly the questions where we are trying to get an opinion. For these questions we may influence answer by providing a list of answers.

* __Keep the survey short and easy__. People are very busy and we need to think about the trade-off between "nice to know" *versus* "must know" based on what we want to obtain from the survey.

We tryied our best to address these points. When you review our pilot survey, pelase keep in mind these points and tell us where and how we can do better. Thansks!

#### How to contribute?

Once you have an issue you want to contribute to, then please:

1. **Fork the repository**. Create your own version of the repository.
2. **Make your changes**. Change the project and work on your issue.
3. **Commit changes**. Commit your changes.
4. **Create a pull request**. Submit a pull request so the leads see that there are changes, and so that there can be a discussion around your changes.

#### How to report bugs?

There are bound to be bugs in any project, and so we would love it if you could be on the lookout for any bugs, and raise an issue if you find one. Bugs can be anything - they could be with our conceptual design, with how we set something out, spelling mistakes or formatting errors, or anything else we haven't yet thought of.

If you notice a bug, then raise an issue and label it with the label 'bug'. Then anyone in the contributing community can get right on it, and everything gets fixed faster. THANK YOU!

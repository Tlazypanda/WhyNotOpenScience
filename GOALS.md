### Goals of the project

*This section is organised as follows:
1) General goals
2) Broad ideas we want to cover
3) Existing materials/sources
4) Relevant Wellcome Trust survey questions for inspiration/adaptation*

Below are broad goals of the project with more specific aims under each heading.

General: Measure researcher's current level of engagement with OS practices

General: Measure obstacles to adoption of OS practices - break down in different OS topics (open data, open source, open access publications, etc.)

#### What do researchers (initially students and postdocs?) know about open science? Consider age, cultural background, language.
 - different software/program for working open
 - what does being open mean to you? what is open science to you?
 
#### What facilities/programs/software/tools do researchers know about to help them practice open science?
- different software/programs -> see 101 Innovations survey

#### Do researchers practice open science?
Maybe a list, such as: _yes I do this_, _no I don't do this_, _I have not thought about this_, _this does not apply to me_
- Open discussion of research ideas
- Open discussion of methodology
- Collaboration on methodology
- Usage of publicly available scripts for methodology
- Usage of publicly available scripts for analysis
- Collaboration on data analysis
- Uploading of methodology scripts to an online repository/accessible resource
- Uploading of data scripts to an online repository/accessible resource
- Sharing of data
- Collaborative writing
- Use of collaborative open source writing software
- Upload pre-prints to a pre-print server
- Upload pre-prints to a repository
- Upload post-prints to a repository
- Blog
- Science communication
- online thesis writing (see Achintya Rao: https://github.com/RaoOfPhysics/201702_OpenThesisPlan)

#### Why do researchers adopt open science practices?
Free text question? Or think of possibilties, adapted from WT, and a free-text section

#### Why do researchers not adopt open science practices?
- Fear of being scooped?
- Lack of peer pressure?
- Lack of institutional pressure?
- Lack of reward?
- Lack of time?
- Lack of knowledge about how to engage in open science?
- Lack of knowledge about how to put open science in practice in a practical way (i.e. which tools to use)?

Free-text section.

#### What would researchers like to encourage them to engage in open science?
See WT survey for different incentives, also think of own.

#### What are we measuring?
 - attiudes
 - perceptions of knowledge
 - behaviour
 - skills

#### Relevant questions from the WellcomeTrust survey
What kind of researcher are you?

How many years have you been working in research?

In which country do you mainly carry out your research?
(dropdown selection list)

Which methodologies do you apply in your research? (select all that apply)

Please rate the importance of the following factors in choosing a journal for publication of your work.
 - IF
 - reputation
 - high quality peer review
 - peers publish there
 - short time from submission to publication
 - publish free
 - low cost
 - immediate OA
 - data available
 - other
 
How many peer-reviewed journal papers (approx) have you published in the last 5 years?
(write number)

How many of these have been OA? [DEFINE OA]

Why do you not make your papers OA?

Which extra features do you think should be provided in future research publication systems? (select all that apply)

In just a few words, what single thing would encourage you to publish more of your work in fully Open Access 
journals?

In just a few words, what would you change about the scholarly publishing system if you were able
to?

In the last 5 years how many datasets have you made available to the research community through a repository, data 
archive, journal, project website, online database or other online form? (write number)

What access level did you set for these data? (select all that apply)

In which repositories or databases have you made these data available? (and provide names)

How important are these reasons for you to make data available in a repository, data archive, journal, project website 
or other online form?
 - funding requirement
 - journal expects data to be accessible
 - research community expects it
 - good research practice
 - collaboration and contribution
 - public health benefits/emergencies
 - ethical obligation towards participants
 - contributes to academic credentials
 - validation and replication
 - improved visibility
 - more credit and more citations
 
What benefits have you personally experienced from making your research data available? (select all that apply)

Have you had any bad experiences from making data available to other researchers?

What do you consider to be barriers to making your research data available?
 - lost publication options
 - misuse of misinterpretation of data
 - insufficient skills to prepare data
 - time-consuming
 - no funding to prepare data
 - no permission
 - data cannot be identified
 - commercial sensitivity
 - third party rights
 - no suitable repository
 - country specific regulations do not enable sharing
 
What would motivate you to make (more) data available in a repository, data centre or other online form? (select all 
that apply)

Do you reuse data?

Are you producing code in your research (e.g. Stata do files, Perl scripts, source code, R analytical code, syntax, algorithms, software, simulation models) ?

In the last 5 years, how many code packages/bundles have you made available to the research community in a 
repository or via another online form? (write number)

How important are these reasons for you to make code available in a repository or other online form?
 - funding requirement
 - journal expects data to be accessible
 - research community expects it
 - good research practice
 - collaboration and contribution
 - public health benefits/emergencies
 - ethical obligation towards participants
 - contributes to academic credentials
 - validation and replication
 - improved visibility

### Goals of the project

Below are broad goals of the project with more specific aims under each heading.

#### What do researchers (initially students and postdocs?) know about open science?

#### What facilities/programs/software/tools do researchers know about to help them practice open science?

#### Do researchers practice open science?
- Open discussion of research ideas
- Open discussion of methodology
- Collaboration on methodology
- Usage of publicly available scripts for methodology
- Usage of publicly available scripts for analysis
- Collaboration on data analysis
- Uploading of methodology scripts to an online repository/accessible resource
- Uploading of data scripts to an online repository/accessible resource
- Sharing of data
- Collaborative writing
- Use of collaborative open source writing software
- Upload pre-prints to a pre-print server
- Upload pre-prints to a repository
- Upload post-prints to a repository
- Blog
- Science communication


#### Why do researchers not adopt open science practices?
- Fear of being scooped?
- Lack of peer pressure?
- Lack of institutional pressure?
- Lack of reward?
- Lack of time?
- Lack of knowledge about how to engage in open science?
- Lack of knowledge about how to put open science in practice in a practical way (i.e. which tools to use)?

#### What are the obstacles faced in adopting open science practices?

#### What would researchers like to encourage them to engage in open science?


##### Existing material:
- we can use information from the Utrecht Library survey?
- wellcome trust survey
- other surveys? Find relevant information
